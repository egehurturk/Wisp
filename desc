Wisp app Description and MAIN features:

    * Strava-like run logging with map display (a map display similar to google maps display when you start a route from start place to a direction, and it will start from your start GPS location and as you run through it will update similar to google maps), heart rate (if available) display while running, and pace / avarege pace, total distance, and other statistics displayed on the run screen while recording a run
    * Ghost feature: ghosts are your competitors. The competitors can be your past runs (you can select), your PRs, your custom goals, your Strava friends, or training plans.
    * Local discovery feature: As you run with your friends (and the whole group is using the Wisp app), you can create a Group by adding other users, and in that tab it will show a map with all the other users running and it will show real-time locations of other people in your Group, and display statistics such as pace or heart rate (if availablee) as a tooltip.
    * Should be easily integrable with Strava, noting that the activites can be exported to Strava, or any past runs/friends from Strava can be imported into the app.

UI Description:
    * Home page with a tab at the bottom, in the middle there's a record button that when pressed, it will go to "Select Run Type" screen. The bottom tab will also have icons for Home, Settings (at the far right), Runs (for past runs), Statistics (for past run statistics), a Ghost icon (where it will lead to a page related to "Ghosts" concept), and an icon for Groups (where you can create friend groups to run with). 
        * Then, in Home screen, it will show Past runs as cards, each card having a map of the route, and more importantly it will display information about the race between your saved run vs the ghost run in that session. Each card will have a replay button that will show the race between you vs the ghost of that session.
    * Home page will have the user profile rounded button on the top right, when clicked it will lead to its profile. One can access friends list, user preferences, user profile (edit, view, etc), and other things through there.
    * Home page will also feature Custom Goal Ghosts (aka training plans) as model cards, with start run buttons on them as an icon (without text)
    * The record run when pressed should lead to "Select Run Type" screen as described above. 
        * The select run type screen should allow you to choose from 2 different running modes, first being "run from ghosts", the second being "run with a group from a ghost". Note that these two should be big and designed nicely. 
        * When pressed on "run from ghosts", it will lead to a page where you can select which ghost you like to run with. It should feature all of the ghosts in the library. Create mock/stub ghosts for now, including ghosts for your PRs, Strava friends (with Strava logo), custom Ghost types. Then, after selecting it, it will display the current run statistics in bold typeface, similar to Strava or Nike's app. The statistics should be: time, distance, average pace for now, pace in the current km/mile split, heart rate data (if available), cadence (if available). It should be minimal, similar to Strava or Nike's app, displaying some statistics at the top with big-bold typeface, and displaying a Map that has your location progressing through by drawing a red line from your starting location to your current location facing forward, and displaying an animated Ghost behind or in front of you. The goal is to again chase with the ghost.
            * When the run is paused, it will not display the map but the statistics.
            * When the run is finished, it will go to a Run summary page, where you'll see the summary of your run and the ghost summary.
            * In that page, there will be a button that will allow you to save the run. If clicked on it, it will save the run to your profile. If the discard button is selected it will discard the run.
        * If "run with group" is selected, then it should lead to another page where it should allow you to choose which group you'll send invites to. After selecting the Group, you should be able to select a Ghost for the whole group. For other users in the group selected, they should receieve a notificaion or an invite for the group run invitation. If everyone on the group accepts the invitation, everyone except the Group leader advances to a temporary page where it will display a big text "Waiting for the Group Leader to start the run". The group leader will advance to a page where a new run can be started. When the group leader starts the run, everyone will have the display of their own statistics above in big bold typeface, and a map that shows real-time locations of everyone in the group with their statistics as small tooltips, and their routes. It will also show the designated ghost following its route. When the run is over (when the group leader presses finish), everyone will lead to a Post-Run screen where a leaderboard will be displayed with statistics for each people and the map with the route. Users that finish behind the ghost will receieve no points within the group, and according to the leaderboard, users will receieve points for their ranking.
    * The Runs page will show past runs as cards, similar to Strava's on your activites tab. It will show information about the Ghost and your statistics, and will show a small animation where the winner (either the ghost or your profile) lifting a small animated trophy. 
    * The statistics should show your past run statistics, the rivarly between ghosts and you, and should be a statistics screen as you wish.
    * The Ghost page should be a page where you can add ghosts, edit ghosts, or view your ghosts. A ghost can be added from past-runs (if a ghost is added from a past run, the ghost will follow the exact same route with exact same splits from that run), from your PRs, from your (Strava) friends' runs, from custom goals (by manually entering run statistics that you want to achieve (target pace, etc)), or from training plans available. 
    * The Groups will display the groups you are in, with options to create a group, or edit and delete a group if you are the group leader. Any groups you create you will be the group leader. As you click a specific group from the groups page, you can see past runs within the group and a general leaderboard within the group.
    * The settings will be a general settings page with settings that allow you to change units, theme, etc.

Other remarks:
    * If the app is in background, it should still work (refresh in the background and continue logging the run).
    * Health, location, etc access should be retrieved. 
        * For instance, for health access, if heart rate data is not available, do not display heart rate at all. If it is available, display it.
    * Integration with Strava


Future ideas:
[] Ghost customization (ghost style -- skins, etc.)


[] Pricing:
    [] Free tier:
        [] 5 groups, at most 4 people within a group
        [] 3 ghosts
        [] Limited training plans for ghosts
    [] Premium tier:
        [] Unlimited ghosts, unlimited groups, unlimited people in a group



* The runs you won and the runs you lost their cards should be different
* Runs page the top statistics (total runs etc) should not be stick
* When clicked on the user profile button in home screen, it should display a collapsable small navbar will display the name, location of the user, a link to change profile, a link to settings, a link to sign out, a link to other things you find suitable.
